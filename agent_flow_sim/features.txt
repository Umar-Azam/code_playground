erdos renye phase transition dynamics in work environment information flows with 
human agent collaboration.

Observation of phase transition dynamics based on workflows as tasks are offloaded from 
humans to agents. 

1. variable node hopping. 
2. percentage of work agents can do for people
3. distribution of tasks difficulties and time consumption
4. human to agent information flow modeling
-a. Task completion requires input from other people. intermittently available  
-b. Task completion requires manual input of time and effort. 
5. agent to agent information flow modeling. 


draw graph -> Human given task -> completes it
 -> human given task portion of task agent can do, validate afterwards.
 -> Process of agent improving over time for a given task. 

all the probabilities involved
probability of having an agent
probability agent can solve the tasks conditioned on the task category 
learning dynamics probability.
